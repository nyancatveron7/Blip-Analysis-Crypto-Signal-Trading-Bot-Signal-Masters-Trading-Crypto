# Signal service

Every minute, the signaler performs the following steps to make a prediction about whether the price is likely to increase or decrease:
* Retrieve the latest data from the server and update the current data window which includes some history (the history length is defined by a configuration parameter)
* Compute derived features based on the nearest history collected (which now includes the latest data). The features to be computed are described in the configuration file and are exactly the same as used in batch mode during model training
* Apply several (previously trained) ML models by forecasting some future values (not necessarily prices) which are also treated as (more complex) derived features. We apply several forecasting models (currently, Gradient Boosting, Neural network, and Linear regression) to several target variables (labels)
* Aggregate the results of forecasting produced by different ML models and compute the final signal score which reflects the strength of the upward or downward trend. Here we use many previously computed scores as inputs and derive one output score. Currently, it is implemented as an aggregation procedure but it could be based on a dedicated ML model trained on previously collected scores and the target variable. Positive score means growth and negative score means fall
* Use the final score for notifications
